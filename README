The FFT algorithm included was written by Ooura ( http://www.kurims.kyoto-u.ac.jp/~ooura/fft.html ),
so all thanks and questions for the core of this code go in that direction.

This code is in a state of flux, and I'm not quite satisfied with its calling conventions,
but for now, it fits the bill.

If you'd like to see it in action, check out the YouTube video I made
for my iPhone app oScope, which uses the FFT pretty directly:

If you use this code in a paid app, please consider donating. Do send me an email
if you choose to use it, regardless.
